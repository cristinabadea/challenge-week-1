# Challenge Week 1

## Description

I took the existing code (located in the Starter pack) and refactor it in order to meet a certain set of standards (for example, naming convensions, usage of HTML semantics etc.), to improve accesibility and long term sustainability.

## Usage

Each part of the website is easily accesible through the HTML semantic elements which clearly describe their meaning.
The accesiblity was also improved by adding the comments in both HTML and CSS documents, by including the "alt" attribute on the <img> tag, by removing the unnecessary classes and ids, and by reorganizing the CSS file and also removing the redundant code.
